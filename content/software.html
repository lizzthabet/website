            <h2>MIME</h2>
            <p>An easy-to-use, minimalist wireframing tool powered by machine learning.</p>

            <p>As you sketch, Mime transforms your hand-drawn circles and rectangles into clean shapes in real-time. It's powered by a custom-built TensorFlow.js (TF) model that we trained to recognize basic shapes using strokes drawn on an HTML canvas.</p>
            <p>The front-end workspace relies on React-Konva.js to create moveable, transformable shapes, Socket.io to communicate with the TF model, and React/Redux to manage wireframe rendering and updates. Each wireframe is automatically saved to a PostgreSQL database and accessible through a unique URL.</p>
            <p>Built in collaboration with Chiara Marcial Mart√≠nez and Ivan Felix.</p>
            <small>Note: Mime's deployment is a little delayed as we work through an issue with the TensorFlow team. View the demo to get a full walkthrough of the application.</small>

            <p>Directory is an experimental resource list that gathers lectures, meetups, groups, zines, books, videos, pdfs, and people who engage with technology, art, activism, movement, networks, and theory in overlapping and myriad ways. It started out as my own mental mind map because I found I was often sharing resources with people across disciplines. Directory uses a simple framework called <a href="http://thisisourwork.net/binder/#About" class="plain">Binder</a> to leverage the power of Google Docs for collaboration. Contribute by adding links and descriptions.</p>

            <h2>&#8984; A</h2>
            <p><i>&#8984; A</i> is a collection of poems written by bots and delivered directly to my spam folder. Embedded in emails as white text on a white background, the bots' words are easy to miss, but they serve an important function. Through half-formed sentences, they attempt to pass themselves off as human, or human-enough, to bypass your spam folder and be diligently delivered to your inbox. Extracted from their original context, the messages might be cryptic love notes or part of an epic dark tale, lost in a failed gesture toward communication.</p>
            <p>Below, you can refactor the the original email to create your own poem-speech and send a message back to your spam bot soul mate.</p>
