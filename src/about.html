        <p>
          I’m an artist, programmer, and powerlifter. These practices provide different interfaces for investigating my own being in the world and the performances of looking and being seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work often starts with drawing as an intuitive exploration and reflection. These sketches evolve into wearable readymades, hand-drawn zines, performative videos, interactive programs, and other objects that allow me to live inside them. My work builds alternate realities where monsters roam and images take on their own desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="/rager">last book I published</a> is a small collection of drawings about emotional labor and an end of the world. It includes the first pictures I made of my anger, if it had a body and eyes and teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approach images as if they’re alive and can speak back to me. I try to create metaphors large enough I can walk into them. Taking dreams and metaphors seriously (and literally) allows me to stretch and test their meanings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently designing a costume for myself to imagine what it might be like to have (more) agency over my body’s visibility in public spaces. This armor includes translucent resin chest plates and a browser-based tool for <a href="https://camouflage-generator-demo.glitch.me/">generating speculative camouflage</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In programming, there’s a concept called a `promise` that represents an activity that takes an unknown amount of time to complete. A `promise` usually `resolves` with the result, calculation, or resource you were looking for, or it `rejects` with an error. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My work is (intentionally) full of these requests that never complete nor error out; there are promises that I can’t resolve for myself. There’s room in this in-between space to continually “practice.” Asking impossible questions and scripting un-resolvable promises is my way of worldbuilding.
