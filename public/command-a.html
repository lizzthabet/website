        <h2>&#8984; A</h2>
        <p><i>&#8984; A</i> is a collection of poems written by bots and delivered directly to my spam folder. Embedded in emails as white text on a white background, the bots' words are easy to miss, but they serve an important function. Through half-formed sentences, they attempt to pass themselves off as human, or human-enough, to bypass your spam folder and be diligently delivered to your inbox. Extracted from their original context, the messages might be cryptic love notes or part of an epic dark tale, lost in a failed gesture toward communication.</p>
        <p>Below, you can refactor the the original email to create your own poem-speech and send a message back to your spam bot soul mate.</p>
