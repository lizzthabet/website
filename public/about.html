          <p>
            Lizz Thabet is an artist and programmer excited about homemade internets and technology skill-share. Her work touches <a href="https://meetmeonthedeep.net" target="_blank">interactive software</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lizzthabet/folder-party-generator" target="_blank">open-source tools</a>, <a href="https://self-host.lizz.website/workshop-excerpt.pdf" target="_blank">skill-share workshops</a>, <a href="./i-am-hiding.html" target="_blank">wearable costumes</a>, and <a href="./rager.html" target="_blank">strange drawings</a>. Tinkering with digital networks is a way for her to build personal and social practices of computing, as well as invest in alternative infrastructures that are both material and ideological.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past few years, Lizz has given workshops and written guides for creative communities on self-hosting websites using privacy-centric tools. They approach teaching as a way to do ideas out loud with others and orients their work towards investing in forms of collective power rather then individual ethical choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In their day job, Lizz builds tools for other programmers with an eye towards open-source projects and accessible websites.
